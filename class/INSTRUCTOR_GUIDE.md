3. **Practice** - Independent completion of challenges
4. **Review** - Code discussion and feedback
5. **Apply** - Integration into larger projects

### **Progressive Complexity**
Each lesson builds upon previous knowledge while introducing new concepts at a manageable pace:

```
Simple ‚Üí Complex
Abstract ‚Üí Concrete  
Individual ‚Üí Integrated
Practice ‚Üí Production

- **Ask predictive questions** - "What do you think happens if...?"

#### **After Coding**
- **Run and test immediately** - Verify it works
- **Refactor together** - Show improvement process
- **Discuss alternatives** - Multiple solutions exist
- **Connect to bigger picture** - How does this fit the project?

### **Student Engagement Strategies**

#### **Interactive Elements**
- **Prediction questions** before revealing code results
- **Code review sessions** where students explain their solutions
- **Pair programming** for complex challenges
- **Mini-challenges** throughout the lesson to maintain engagement

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **StatefulWidget Lifecycle Management**
```dart
// Comprehensive lifecycle monitoring with performance tracking
class TaskController extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  State<TaskController> createState() => _TaskControllerState();
}

class _TaskControllerState extends State<TaskController> 
    with LifecycleMixin<TaskController> {
  
  @override
  void onInitStateCallback() {
    // Custom initialization with monitoring
    _initializeController();
  }

  @override
  Widget buildWidget(BuildContext context) {
    // Performance-monitored build method
    return widget.child(this);
  }

  @override
  void onDisposeCallback() {
    // Proper resource cleanup
    _disposeResources();
  }
}
```

### **Advanced setState Patterns**
```dart
// Safe setState with performance monitoring
void setStateWithMonitoring(VoidCallback fn, [String? description]) {
  if (!mounted) return;

  final setStateStart = DateTime.now();
  setState(fn);
  final setStateDuration = DateTime.now().difference(setStateStart);
  
  performanceMonitor.recordSetState(widgetName, setStateDuration);
}

// Batch setState for multiple updates
void batchSetState(List<VoidCallback> operations, [String? description]) {
  if (!mounted) return;
  
  setStateWithMonitoring(() {
    for (final operation in operations) {
      operation();
    }
  }, description ?? 'Batched setState (${operations.length} operations)');
}

// Async setState with error handling
Future<void> asyncSetState(
  Future<void> Function() asyncOperation,
  VoidCallback onSuccess, {
  void Function(Object error)? onError,
}) async {
  try {
    await asyncOperation();
    if (mounted) {
      setStateWithMonitoring(onSuccess, 'Async setState success');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    if (onError != null && mounted) {
      setStateWithMonitoring(() => onError(error), 'Error handling');
    }
  }
}
```

### **Immutable State Patterns**
```dart
// Immutable state objects with copyWith patterns
@immutable
class AppState {
  const AppState({
    this.tasks = const [],
    this.filter = const TaskFilter(),
    this.loadingState = LoadingState.idle,
    // ... other properties
  });

  final List<Task> tasks;
  final TaskFilter filter;
  final LoadingState loadingState;

  // Immutable update pattern
  AppState copyWith({
    List<Task>? tasks,
    TaskFilter? filter,
    LoadingState? loadingState,
  }) {
    return AppState(
      tasks: tasks ?? this.tasks,
      filter: filter ?? this.filter,
      loadingState: loadingState ?? this.loadingState,
    );
  }

  // Convenience update methods
  AppState updateTasks(List<Task> newTasks) {
    return copyWith(tasks: newTasks, lastUpdated: DateTime.now());
  }
}
```

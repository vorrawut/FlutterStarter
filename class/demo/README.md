## 🏗️ Architecture

Clean Architecture with feature-based organization:

```
lib/
├── core/           # Constants, theme, routing, storage
├── features/       # Auth, home, groups, chat, quiz, profile
├── shared/         # Reusable widgets and services
└── test/          # Unit, widget, and integration tests
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
flutter test              # All tests
flutter test --coverage  # With coverage
flutter test test/unit/   # Unit tests only
```

## 📚 Learning Resources

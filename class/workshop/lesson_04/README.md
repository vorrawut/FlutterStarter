   - Try nested Stack widgets
   - Build a simple card layout

#### **Intermediate Challenges**
3. **Build Custom Widgets**
   - Create a weather widget with icon and temperature
   - Design a social media post widget
   - Build a progress indicator widget

4. **Add Interactions**
   - Implement a rating widget with stars
   - Create a expandable/collapsible card
   - Add gesture detection to images

#### **Advanced Challenges**
5. **Widget Composition**
   - Build a complete user profile screen
   - Create a settings page with multiple widget types
   - Design a dashboard with data visualization

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add const constructors where appropriate
   - Implement widget keys for list items
   - Optimize rebuild performance

### Step 4: Compare with Solution

Once you've completed the workshop, you'll have learned:
- Advanced widget implementations
- Performance optimizations
- Professional coding patterns
- Enhanced user interactions

## üéì Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you should be able to:

- [ ] **Understand Widget Architecture**
  - Explain the widget tree concept
  - Differentiate between StatelessWidget and StatefulWidget
  - Understand widget lifecycle methods

- [ ] **Master Basic Widgets**
  - Use Text widgets with various styling options
  - Display images from different sources
  - Implement icons and containers effectively
  - Apply decorations and styling

- [ ] **Create Layouts**
  - Build horizontal and vertical layouts with Row/Column
  - Use Stack for overlapping widgets
  - Implement scrollable lists
  - Control space distribution with Expanded/Flexible

- [ ] **Handle User Interaction**
  - Implement various button types
  - Create form inputs and text fields
  - Manage widget state with setState()
  - Detect gestures and user actions

- [ ] **Build Custom Widgets**
  - Extract reusable widget components
  - Follow widget development best practices
  - Compose complex widgets from simple ones
  - Optimize for performance and maintainability

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Widget Overflow Errors**
```
Solution: Use Flexible, Expanded, or SingleChildScrollView
Example: Wrap your Column in SingleChildScrollView
```

#### **State Not Updating**
```
Solution: Ensure you're calling setState() for StatefulWidget
Check: Are you modifying state variables inside setState()?
```

#### **Widget Tree Too Deep**
```
Solution: Extract widgets into separate classes or methods
Pattern: Break large build() methods into smaller widgets
```

#### **Hot Reload Not Working**
```
Solution: Check for syntax errors and save the file
Alternative: Try hot restart (Shift+R) instead of hot reload
```

### Debug Tips
- Use Flutter Inspector to visualize widget tree
- Add print statements to understand widget lifecycle
- Use Debug Paint to see widget boundaries
- Check the console for helpful error messages

### **Step 4: Create Custom Widgets**

Replace the body of your Scaffold with this beautiful welcome interface:

```dart
body: SingleChildScrollView(
  child: Column(
    children: [
      const WelcomeCard(
        title: 'Welcome to Flutter!',
        subtitle: 'Build beautiful apps for any platform with a single codebase',
        icon: Icons.flutter_dash,
        color: Colors.blue,
      ),
      const WelcomeCard(
        title: 'Hot Reload Magic',
        subtitle: 'See your changes instantly without losing app state',
        icon: Icons.flash_on,
        color: Colors.orange,
      ),
      const WelcomeCard(
        title: 'Widget Composition',
        subtitle: 'Create complex UIs by combining simple, reusable widgets',
        icon: Icons.widgets,
        color: Colors.green,
      ),
      // Counter demo section
      Container(
        margin: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primaryContainer,
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(12),
        ),
        child: Column(
          children: [
            Text(
              'Counter Demo',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineSmall,
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 16),
            const Text(
              'You have pushed the button this many times:',
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 8),
            Text(
              '$_counter',
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineLarge?.copyWith(
                color: Theme.of(context).colorScheme.primary,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    ],
  ),
),
```

### **Step 5: Add the Custom WelcomeCard Widget**

Add this reusable widget class to your `main.dart` file:

```dart
class WelcomeCard extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  final String subtitle;
  final IconData icon;
  final Color color;

  const WelcomeCard({
    super.key,
    required this.title,
    required this.subtitle,
    required this.icon,
    required this.color,
  });

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      elevation: 4,
      margin: const EdgeInsets.all(16),
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
        child: Column(
          mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
          children: [
            Icon(
              icon,
              size: 48,
              color: color,
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 16),
            Text(
              title,
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineSmall?.copyWith(
                color: color,
                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
              ),
            ),
            const SizedBox(height: 8),
            Text(
              subtitle,
              style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.bodyMedium,
              textAlign: TextAlign.center,
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

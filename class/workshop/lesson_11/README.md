## 🆘 **Getting Help**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**ProviderNotFoundException?**
- Ensure Provider is available above the widget trying to access it
- Check MultiProvider setup includes all required providers
- Verify context is from a widget below the Provider in the tree
- Use debugProvider tools to inspect Provider availability

**State not updating as expected?**
- Verify ChangeNotifier.notifyListeners() is called after state changes
- Check if using context.read() vs context.watch() appropriately
- Ensure Consumer or Selector is properly configured
- Use Provider.debugCheckInvalidValueType for debugging

**Performance issues with frequent rebuilds?**
- Use Selector instead of Consumer for specific property access
- Implement const constructors and child parameters where possible
- Profile with Provider.debugCheckInvalidValueType development mode
- Use RepaintBoundary to isolate expensive widget rebuilds

**Testing Provider-based widgets?**
- Use ChangeNotifierProvider.value for providing test data
- Create mock providers with proper ChangeNotifier behavior
- Test state changes separately from UI interactions
- Use pumpAndSettle for async state updates in tests

### **Debugging Tools**
- **Provider.debugCheckInvalidValueType** - Validate Provider setup during development
- **Flutter Inspector** - Examine Provider widget tree and dependencies
- **ChangeNotifier debugging** - Monitor listener registration and notification
- **Performance tools** - Profile rebuild frequency and performance impact

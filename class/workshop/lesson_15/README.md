## 🏗️ **Project Architecture**

The AuthFlow Pro application uses a **hybrid state management strategy**:

```
📱 AuthFlow Pro
├── 🎯 Authentication (Bloc)     - Complex business logic, audit trails
├── ⚡ Theme Management (Riverpod) - Reactive updates, type safety
├── 🔄 User Settings (Provider)   - Shared state, simple operations
└── 📱 Local UI State (setState)  - Forms, animations, toggles
```

### **Strategic Pattern Selection**

| Concern | Pattern | Rationale |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Authentication Flows** | **Bloc** | Complex business logic, event-driven architecture, audit trails required |
| **Theme Management** | **Riverpod** | Reactive updates, type safety, auto-disposal for theme changes |
| **User Settings** | **Provider** | Shared state across app, simple CRUD operations, mature ecosystem |
